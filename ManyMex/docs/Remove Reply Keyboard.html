    <h1>Remove Reply Keyboard</h1>
    Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard.
    <p>By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot.</p>
    <p>An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see <a href="Reply Keyboard.html">Reply Keyboard</a>).</p>
